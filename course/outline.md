Course Outline
--------------
Introduce children to fundamental computer science concepts using the python programming language.  This course is designed to give children a basic understanding of several concepts in computer science such as what a program is and basics on how computers work.

This course is meant for children 7+

## Computer Basics
* What is a computer?
  * A device you can use to:
    * play video games!
    * create visual art!
    * create and record music!
    * create software to help people!
    * learn about the world you live in!
    * work with others all over the globe!

* What is the difference between hardware and software?
  * hardware is
    * the physical computer
    * made up of several distinct parts including
      * Keyboard
        * You use the keyboard to input data into the computer.  Such as your name in name.py!
      * Mouse / Trackpad
        * This is used as a pointer to objects on the screen.
      * Video output (screen)
        * The most obvious part of the computer.  Where all the action happens!
      * Central processing unit (CPU)
        * The CPU is the part of the computer that runs programs.
        * Popular CPU's are Intel x86, AMD64, Fujitsu SPARC, ARM
      * Random Access Memory (RAM)
        * Programs are stored in RAM while they are running.
        * The Operating System is stored in RAM while the computer is running.
        * The RAM does not hold any information when the computer is off.
      * Hard Disk or drive (HD)
        * The hard drive stores information for the computer permanently, even while it is off.
        * Boot ups occur when computer pulls information stored on the hard drive into RAM and begins to execute it.
      * Communication buses (USB, PCI, PCI express)
        * Communication buses pass information around the computer.
        * Your keyboard and mouse are usually plugged into the USB bus.
        * Your screen is usually plugged into a video card which is plugged into the PCI bus.
        * The Operating System uses communication buses to transfer information to different devices.
  * software is
    * the programs which the computer runs perform useful tasks
    * games
    * financial
    * operating system

* What type of *computer* am I using right now?
  * laptop?  what makes it a laptop?
  * desktop?  what makes it a desktop?
  * pad?  what makes it a pad?

* What is an *Operating System*?
  * An operating system is _software_ that defines the environment in which other programs can run.
  * What operating system are you running right now?
    * MacOS?
    * Windows?
    * FreeBSD?
    * Linux?

* How is an *Operating System* different from the computer?
  * The operating system is software, the computer is the hardware.
  * 


## System login and password basics
* Many operating systems require a username and password to begin using the software.  This is called logging into your system.
  * UNIX type systems like Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and AIX require uses to login


## Playing with the python shell environment
* Using the shell to play with math variables
* Using print to 
* What is an integer?
* What is a string?
* How to use python to do math?


## Variables


## Manipulating variables
* Create a string variable
* Create an integer variable


## Basic file editing and manipulation
* Using nano to edit files


## Conditionals


## Looping
